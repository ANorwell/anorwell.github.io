<p>In theory, a phone should double as a great music player. In 
practice, my iPhone 3GS goes through batteries at an incredible rate: 
often, I'll listen to it for a few hours, and the batteries will have 
gone down by 50% or more. This isn't normal for music players. IPods and Zunes last for multiple days without needing a recharge, and there's nothing about the IPhone that should make playing music harder. The most likely culprit is that the phone is sending or receiving data while playing music.<br>
</p>
<p>So I ran a few tests. Each test involved playing music for half an hour, and recording the change in battery level. From these, it's easy to calculate a battery lifetime for the task. The results:</p>
<h2>Music Player Battery Lifetime by Enabled Data Mode:</h2>
<ul><li><strong>3G network (no wireless):</strong> 5 hours</li><li><strong>Edge network</strong>: 10 hours</li><li><strong>Wireless network</strong>: 12.5 hours</li><li><strong>Airplane mode</strong>: ~100 hours<br>
 </li></ul><p>Because of the inaccurate methodology [1], these numbers should be 
taken as ballpark figures. The battery usage in all of these modes when 
no apps are running is close enough to zero to be ignored, so the 
battery drain here is primarily from music playing and associated 
tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the questions are, what is it doing, and how do I stop this? I 
don't particularly care to send Apple usage information, or to fetch 
lyrics and artist info (these settings were disabled for the the tests).
 I just want to listen to music, without disconnecting my phone from the
 internet. This doesn't exactly sound like a niche requirement.</p>
<p>Phone configuration:<br>
</p>
<ul><li>Jailbroken iPhone 3GS running on Rogers' network, software <strong>4.0.1</strong><br>
 </li><li>Constant "medium" volume for all tests<br>
 </li><li>"Lyrics and Podcast Info" IPod app setting disabled, along with all other IPod app settings</li></ul><span style="font-size: 10px;">[1]
 This is only accurate to within 1%, so particularly for the tests with 
low battery usage, the extrapolated battery lifetime can be quite 
inaccurate. For the tests with data enabled, the phone is still checking
 email and doing other background tasks that might introduce a small 
battery overhead. </span><br>
