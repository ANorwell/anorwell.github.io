	Back when I worked at Tellme, I had the chance to give a few technical interviews. In retrospect, one of my mistakes was asking questions that were too hard. It&rsquo;s tempting to ask a challenging question, particularly one that requires a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; to solve it. If the interviewee figures it out, then he must be good, right?&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	In reality, he may have just heard the problem before. Furthermore, if someone fails to answer a question that is hard, you don&rsquo;t learn very much. Good people can get hard interview questions wrong within the timeframe and format of an interview. Perhaps they don&rsquo;t notice the trick required to figure out the question.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	On the other hand, if you ask a sufficiently easy question, it acts as a negative filter. If someone fails to answer it, then surely they don&rsquo;t have the technical skill required. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html">Fizzbuzz</a> gives an extreme example of this idea.</div>

<div>
	The best type of question is one that is easy to answer, but harder to answer well. I was asked a question like this last week:</div>
<blockquote>
	<div>
		How do you remove the duplicates from an array of integers?</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
	This is not a hard question. A naive O(n^2) solution doesn&rsquo;t require much thought, but requires coding ability to get the details of an implementation right. An improved O(n*logn) solution requires knowledge of data structures, but is still not that challenging to find. (Sorting the array gives another &ldquo;easy&rdquo; n*logn solution; to avoid this, you can stipulate that the result should be in the same order as the original array, or that the numbers are streaming in.)</div>
<div>
	Any serious applicant should make appreciable progress on this question. A good applicant should be able to solve it completely within the time-frame of an interview. And this should be a much better filter than a harder question that may not correlate well to actual ability.</div>
