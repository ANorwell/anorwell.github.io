<a href="http://anorwell.com/graph/?gid=34">Graph Drawer</a> is the example app I built on top of my <a href="http://anorwell.com/?id=26">Graph.js</a> graph drawing API, and is actually pretty fun. You can share the graphs you draw (the link above goes to my drawing of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_graph">Petersen graph</a>. 
</p>

<p> The tool also provides a way to create graphs, which can then be accessed using the API in other contexts. This is how the graphs in the <a href="http://anorwell.com/?id=26">Graph.js</a> demo were created.</p>
