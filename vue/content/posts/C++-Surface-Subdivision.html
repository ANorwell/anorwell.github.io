This is an old graphics project I did back in 2009. It does a lot of things, but none of them well, and it's not really clear what the point of it is. It's done in C++ using OpenGL, with GLSL shaders.
<br><br>
This will do some of the following:<br>
<ul>
<li> A quaternion camera and movement system
<li> A GLSL Phong shader, as well as some other vertex and fragment shaders.
<li> A half-baked graphics framework for managing scenes, and loading resources
<li> A half-edge data structure implementation for graphics objects
<li> An implementation of Kobbelt's <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.43.1955">sqrt(3) surface subdivision algorithm</a> for smoothing triangular meshes
<li>Probably some other stuff, which I have forgotten.
</ul>
