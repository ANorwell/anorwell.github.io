	The big limitation of my old webhost was the lack of control I had over the backend. It was great at php, and had some python support, but didn&rsquo;t even give me command-line access. Lately I&rsquo;ve been playing with ruby on rails a lot, as well as thinking about the idea of doing things like programmatically generating pdf files and other things that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do with my old host. So I&rsquo;ve switched to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Slicehost</a>. Now I get to run the entire backend myself, which meant some choices.</p>
<p>
	First, I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://nginx.org">nginx</a> as the web server instead of apache. This is because the event-driven architecture of nginx is much better than apache at handling the <i>massive traffic</i> that my website gets. Ok, but seriously, nginx does do some things that make me like it.</p>
<p>
	Unlike Apache, it doesn&rsquo;t try to do everything itself. It delegates dynamic page generation (that is, python, php, ruby, etc) to other processes over a socket or to a server listening locally on another port. For example, I get php support using <a="http:fastcgi.com">FastCGI</a> with the php5-fpm ubuntu package. php5-fpm listens on port 9000, and nginx forwards php requests (locally) to this server. </p>
<p>
	For python web services, I&rsquo;m using <a href="uwsgi.org">uWSGI</a> as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface">WSGI</a> server. Again, nginx forwards python requests over a socket to uWSGI, which manages the python interpreter and responds to a request. This approach differs from other WSGI server implementations that double as web servers; performance-wise, this approach pays off, as <a href="http://nichol.as/benchmark-of-python-web-servers">this benchmark shows</a>. Support for Ruby and other web languages can be added similarly.</p>
<p>
	Another advantage of separating the webserver from the interpreter is that it allows the interpreter to be restarted (to roll out a new version of a script) without the webserver going down.</p>
<p>
	Configuring nginx to do this isn&#39;t hard: here&#39;s the relevent part form my nginx config:</p>
