<p>The most common quantitative metric for evaluating a charity is the administrative overhead percentage. The idea behind this is that the less they spend on administrative overhead, the more good they are doing.  This fails for two reasons. One, the marginal benefit of a charity cannot be measured in terms of dollars spent. Two, it is hardly clear that administrative overhead is a bad thing.</p>

<p>
Since the second issue is more straightforward, we will tackle it first. The argument goes: the larger the percentage of money a charity spends on administrative costs, the less money is put towards their cause. However, it's not clear this distinction makes sense. A large part of administrative fees go towards fund-raising, which in turn generate more money for the charity to put towards their cause. If we assume fundraising has a positive return (a safe assumption--otherwise, no one would do it!), the best action for any charity is to maximize their fundraising percentage: more money on fundraising will create a larger return.</p>

<p>
Of course, this is based on the assumption that the pool of charitable giving is unbounded, and in reality, this is not true. If we assume that the amount of charitable giving is fixed (that is, each person gives a fixed amount to charity each year, and the only choice they make is which charity to give it to), then considering administrative overhead makes much more sense. All fundraising will do is take money from another charity. While fundraising by a particular charity will increase its own income, it on leaves a smaller piece of the pie for the rest of the charities. In this environment, it is vital to give money to only the most effective charities.</p>

<p>
However, charitable giving isn't fixed, either: people give more to causes they care about, and give more if they are encouraged to. Cultural effects are large, as the amount given as a percentage of gross national income varies up to tenfold between countries [1]. And clearly, charitable giving is also not unbounded, because each person can only give so much of their income. The reality is probably somewhere in between: charitable giving can be increased, but there is also a great deal of competition between charities for the dollars.</p>

<p>
The second problem with evaluating charities via administrative overhead is that it assumes the per-dollar good done by charities is equal. Is this true? To answer this, we need a measure of the good done by a charity. However, "good done" is at best ill-defined, and can be extremely subjective and controversial. To address this, I'd like to start with a single, hopefully uncontroversial, axiom: that the life of each human in the world has equal value [2]. Hence, if a charity improves or saves a life, we can measure its effectiveness in terms of dollars per life.</p>

<p>
Let's take two examples. First, a charity that supports cancer research. Far from being a single disease, "cancer" is an umbrella term for a class of diseases in which cells start to grow uncontrollably. For this reason, there will probably never be a global cure for cancer. Rather, research is aimed at targeting particular types of cancer. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly and underfunded, seeing 33,000 US deaths per year at a death rate of about ninety percent [3]. The NCI is spending around $70,000,000 per year on pancreatic cancer research. Second, a charity that supports malarial prevention. Around one million children per year die from malaria, mostly in Africa [4]. Prevention involves basic equipment such as mosquito nets and test kits.</p>

<p>
To be charitable, let's say they prevent all pancreatic cancer deaths in the US with that $70 million per year. This is a pipe dream, but let's pretend. That's around $2,000 dollars per life--an absolute bargain! Surely lives are worth much more, even for the elderly folk that tend to get pancreatic cancer.  How much does it cost to prevent a malarial death? Not more than $100. From our original assumption that all lives has equal value, the only conclusion we can draw is, not only is the malarial charity the better one, but that it is much better--at least twenty times better.</p>

<p>
By this logic, we should encourage the malarial charity to have a high administrative overhead. Every dollar it steals, via fundraising, from the pancreatic charity, is twenty times more effective.  And if the fundraising raises money that would otherwise not be given to charity, then even better.</p>

<p>
The discerning reader has not been fooled by the original premise of this essay. This is not a critique of administrative spending, but rather a discussion about how to choose a charity. [5] Some charities have a much higher marginal benefit than others, in a way that can be roughly judged by evaluating their mandate. A charitable giver should take this into account when giving, and perhaps in life in general.</p>

[2] While it rings true, this is hardly uncontroversial. Can we say a serial killer has the same value as a Nobel-prize winner? Or more to the point, is the life of someone in the third-world worth that of someone in the first-world? Is a minority worth as much as a white person? As far as I can tell, the world seems to think the answer to this last two questions is "no."<br/>

[5] While it is a strong example, this should also not be taken to be a critique of cancer research. Cancer research motivates much medical research that would otherwise not happen. Cancer research is used because its face value seems so high. If one seeks wasteful charities, there is much lower-hanging fruit.</p>
