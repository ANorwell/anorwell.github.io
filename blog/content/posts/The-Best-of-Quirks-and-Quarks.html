I'm posting this from my campsite in Salina, Utah on my phone. This probably shows that my conversion to technophile is complete. I'm not very well equipped--it turns out a propane stove, let alone a fire pit, aren't much good without a lighter or matches. I also remember now that places outside of California have rain.  <br/><br/>

This is day three of my cross-country trip from California to Toronto.  Last night, in a Vegas casino/hotel, was the pilar opposite of tonight. This was my first time in Las Vegas, and I was not very impressed.  Poker is the only kind of gambling worth doing, because the rest are just you against the house. Besides gambling there really debt seem lke much going on. I went to a comedy show, and the 3/4 empty house reinforced that Vegas maybe isn't all it's cracked up to be (although the show wasn't bad).  All of this might be a function of my cheap hotel and the fact i was there alone, though. <br/><br/>

How do you survive a cross-country drive?  I haven't, yet, but ten hours of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/">Quirks and Quarks</a> podcasts surely helps.
