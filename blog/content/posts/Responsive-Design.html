	I&#39;ve been playing around with twitter&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">bootstrap</a>&nbsp;library the last few days. I made a <a href="http://anorwell.com/indexbs.php">version of my site</a> using it, which I think looks pretty nice. The design is minimal and appealing, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design">responds</a> to the size and browser automatically. This means my site looks nice on mobile now too.</p>
<p>
	Maybe I&#39;ll switch to that version of the site once I get social and music integrated.&nbsp;</p>
