      Got a new guitar with a pickup (Taylor 214 CE), a mic, and an interface. Honestly, I can't tell if the recording quality is actually higher--sometimes the bass guitar string especially is crackly--but it definitely gives me a lot more control.  I'm currently recording using audacity, which seems to do the trick.

    As well, I added a jquery.jplayer mp3 player at the top, which supports playlists and hass better cross-browser support.  Annoyingly, the old recordings I had are WMA-with-DRM encoded, the player doesn't support WMA, and conversion seems hard.  So I just kept the WMA player on the page (hidden by default) for the old links.  I don't think I'll be doing anything in WMA in the future.
