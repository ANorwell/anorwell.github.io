	The <a href="http://developers.facebook.com">Facebook developer page</a> can be daunting at first glance: the documentation can be contradictory and confusing, and seems to be constantly changing. A big part of the problem is that they have so many APIs. Some are listed as deprecated, but seem to have no proper replacement.</p>
<p>
	In this post I&#39;ll discuss some of the steps I took when adding a Facebook login button to a site I&#39;m making, and the approach I ended up taking. Our goal is to end up with the facebook id number associated with the user.</p>
<h2>Client-Side flow</h2>
<p>
	<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/login/">Facebook&#39;s documentation for adding a login button</a> proposes the following code (also based on boiler-plate example code from Facebook):</p>
<div id="fbgist1">
	&nbsp;</div>
<script>embed("https://gist.github.com/957773.js?file=gistfile1.html", "fbgist1")</script>
<p>
	Let&#39;s go over what happens here: This happens purely on the client side, in javascript. The &lt;script&gt; tag inclusion of all.js passes two parameters to that script: the app ID (1234512345), which gives the ID of our and the xfbml=1 flag, which indicates that XFBML should be parsed. When the script is loaded by your client, FB.Init will be called, and the XFBML in the page will be parsed. It will discover the &lt;fb:login-button&gt; element, and parse it to replace it with proper HTML and Javascript for a login button.</p>
<p>
	When this login button is pushed, it will transparently make the Javascript API calls to authenticate the user. You may subscribe to the login event using <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.Event.subscribe/">FB.Event.Subscribe</a>. Once the user is logged in, you may get their session information using <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.getLoginStatus/">FB.getLoginStatus</a>.</p>
<p>
	By default, the appearance of the login button after login is not very appealing. The page will either show other friends that have also used this app (this seems too invasive), or show the same login button unchanged (this seems potentially confusing for the user). This would need to be customized by subscribing to the login event.</p>
<h2>
	Server-side flow</h2>
<p>
	The above flow is what Facebook suggests, and is quite simple. However, we may also want the server to have the Facebook session information. The <a href="https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/">PHP SDK</a> provides a means to do this. A Facebook login will automatically create a cookie for your site, which means that if any session information is present, it will be available on your server.</p>
<p>
	I came up with the following code:</p>
<div id="fbgist2"></div>
	<script>embed("https://gist.github.com/957889.js?file=gistfile1.php", "fbgist2")</script>
	<p>
		PHP checks for a currently active session. If one exists, we get it and emit A &quot;currently logged in&quot; state with a logout button. The session is now available both on the server using the PHP API, and to the client. If no session exists, we instead emit the client-side login code from above. Additionally, we set a hook to reload the page when login occurs. When the page reloads, the session will exist.</p>
	<p>
		This approach takes more code, but seems more flexible than the first client-only flow above.</p>
