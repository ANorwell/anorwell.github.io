The life expectancy of a male is 78 years, but I plan to live far past this, statistically speaking. Here's why. Life expectancy is calculated by averaging the age of death of people who die. In other words, <em>my</em> life expectancy isn't 78--that's the life expectancy of people who are already dead. No matter how the data is conditioned (for example, considering deaths of people age 25 or older, non-smokers, who are physically fit and non-overweight), the entire sample size is of people who are dead.

Although I'm not dead, my life expectancy differs only due to the extent by which my life differs from the average dead person. Most importantly, I'm a lot younger. The average dead person (this year) was born in 1932 [1]. People who die this year have had access to modern medical advances this year, but not for the majority of their lives.  More importantly, they won't have access to the medical advances that will be made in the next fifty years, during which I will be alive but they won't. It seems likely that the <em>rate</em> of medical advances in the next fifty years will only increase [2].

This must be a happy accident from the life insurers' perspective. An eighty year old who buys a policy in 2010 might have a life expectancy (according to the 2010 death statistics) of five years, and the insurance company would charge accordingly. When, on average, he lives slightly longer than this, the insurance company makes a bit more money. If you believe in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Competition">perfect competition</a>, you might predict that life insurers have already noticed and accounted for this.

<em>[1] If someone dies in 2010 at an average age of 78, then by linearity of expectation, they are born on average in 1932.<br/>
[2] Hardly a sure thing. Like speech recognition, there may be some cap, beyond which it is very hard to progress. However, a general observation about technology is that as the tool quality increases, the rate of innovation rises. I see no reason this doesn't apply to medicine.  This also assumes that medical advances that are made will be available to me, which might not be true.<br/></em>
