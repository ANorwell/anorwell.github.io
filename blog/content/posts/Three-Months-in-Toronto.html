Now that the term is winding down (inasmuch as there is one for me, with only two courses), there's a bunch of stuff I want to get done:

<ul>
 <li> Fix up this site. This is mostly done, and this post is evidence of that. Beyond that, I'd like to update it more frequently.
 <li> Package up the music I recorded this year into an album, and release it for download somehow.
 <li> Work on some new programming project. I'm not sure what this is yet, but hopefully it will be away from web programming. I've been wanting to learn a lisp dialect for a while now, so this may be the time to do it. I'm also thinking about up my <a href="graph/">Graph Tool</a>, which I feel is working well as an app, to an API.  It would be interesting if the user could specify the appearance of the graph. 
 <li> Continue with some guitar things I'm doing (although there's nothing new about that).
</ul>

</p>

<p>
On a site-related note, embedding things (code snippets, images, etc) now works.  The problem was embedded script tags do not play nicely with XMLHttpRequest, and most of the nice embeddable content uses script tags like this.  This is hard to fix, because the only control one has over included script tags is by overriding the functions they use (such as document.write), and actual inclusion of the &lt;script&gt;'s code happens asynchronously, which means it is difficult to overwrite a function and then clean up after yourself properly.
</p>

<p>It seems to work now, even if the solution is a giant hack.  The more I mess around with making websites, the more flawed the whole process seems. Just supporting Firefox and Chrome--supposedly to be the "friendly" browsers--seems to increase my work substantially over a single browser. I'd hate to think what developing for Internet Explorer is like.
</p>

<p>I've updated posts containing embeddable media so that the media shows properly.</p>
